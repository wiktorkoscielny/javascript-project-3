# Dino Game using JavaScript

## About
It's simple game based on Google Chrome browser game. 

The code uses images that are animated using keyframes. The game is over when properties (left, bottom) of the "objects" reach the indicated value. That function uses getComputedStyle method.
The start of the game and the jump is opearted via event listeners and onclick event due to problems with touch events on mobile.

The code is adapted to both desktop and mobile devices.
